--Question
Consider P1(a,c) and  to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

--Query

SELECT ROUND (sqrt(POWER((MIN(lat_n) - MAX(lat_n)), 2) + POWER ((MIN(long_w)- MAX(long_w )), 2)) , 4)
FROM station
