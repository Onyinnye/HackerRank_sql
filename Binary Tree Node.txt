Binary Tree Nodes

--QUESTION

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

--QUERY

SELECT n, CASE WHEN (p IS Null) THEN 'Root' 
               WHEN (n IN (SELECT DISTINCT p FROM BST)) THEN 'Inner' 
               ELSE 'Leaf' 
               END type
FROM BST
ORDER BY n;
